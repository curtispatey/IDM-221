            Who We Are
        </h2>
        <p class="bodytext">
            We are a student led design group, founded by myself, Curtis Patey, with goals of working with Drexel
            students to help visualize their product goals. I came to Philadelphia, PA from Nashville, TN to attend
            Drexel University. I quickly fell in love with the city and my peers on campus. After an extensive journey
            through engineering, I realized that I needed to find something that matched my interpersonal skills. That
            led me to the Interactive Digital Media program where I am focusing on UX research.
