            Drexel Dragonclimbers Logo

        <p class = "bodytext">
            In this project for Drexelâ€™s Climbing club, I served as the lead designer for their logo and merchandise. Overall, the club is relatively new and disorganized, so they did not have a clear set of goals in mind as an organization. This fact pushed me to prototype rapidly and always to obtain feedback on my designs.

        <p class = "bodytext">
            This is the sketch that led to the overall final design. Keeping in mind that this design would be stitched onto apparel and hats, I went with a linework design that would translate well through the stitching.

        <p class = "bodytext">
            This sketch was to test out the overall color scheme. This being a Drexel organization, I had to operate within the established color scheme. However, we realized that the design would simply look much better on a white background from this digital drawing.

            This final iterations display the resulting logo that will be displayed on hats and shirts for the club.
