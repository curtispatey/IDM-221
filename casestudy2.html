            This project is ongoing, so the images shown are works in progress. Due to my transition from engineering into the digital media field, my university plan is unorthodox. My first-year web design class tasked us to select a site of our choosing and redesign it for a browser screen. I chose a local bookstore's site back home in Nashville, TN. The images below show the home screen in its current state.

            After developing a user persona, I was able to find several sample users that I tasked with performing a card sorting exercise. The card sorting exercise results directly influenced the generation of a new site map, improving on the existing one. Building off of the site map, I then went into the process of wireframing my redesign.

            I continually had to focus on how to make sure that this site was accessible to its users. The users of the site are predominantly older and less familiar with modern website layouts. So through these wireframes, I sought to make sure that the website was more comfortable to navigate and helped the store succeed as an e-commerce platform. These wireframes again influenced the final wireframes that I am currently working on for the redesign.
