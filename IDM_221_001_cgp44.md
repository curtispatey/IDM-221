## **Website inspiration** ##

1. [kylebornphotography](http://www.kylebornphotography.com/)

This site does an excellent job of presenting content. I would draw inspiration from this site because of its simple presentation of content in a cohesive manner. One feature that attracted my eye was the subtle dropdown menu under Architecture. This feature builds upon the exisiting tone of the site while adding functionality, which is something I'd like to draw on. Moreover, the links to control the slideshow fit seamlessly into the existing menu, which I like. This is appealing to me, because it maintains a constant aesthetic on the site while remaining functional.

2. [rogelmedia](https://www.rogelmedia.com/)

The feature that I like the most from this site is the scrolling image stack in the background. This coupled with the simplistic links in the foreground preserves functionality while also advertising content. As someone, who works with various types of media, this would be a useful tool to impliment to advertise my available content while also housing functional links to more specific pages. I also like that the entire menu, including contact and social media is presented together at the top which draws my attention to the images; Again that is something that I would like to impliment.

3. [cohere](https://cohere.city/)

While the other two sites were for individual content creators, this site is for a larger creative agency. The feature that I like the most is their scrolling page that stops and adjusts depending on where the user is on the homepage. The second tier presents a large image that welcomes newer visitors. I think this is a genius tool, especially for more complex organizations. And if I were to collaborate with more creators, this is a tool I would definitely utilize. Also, the split screen scrolling is an appealing tool that I think would add some more interest when interacting with my site.

## **About Me** ##

Hello my name is Curtis Patey. I moved from Nashville TN, where I have lived my whole life to come to Philadelphia for college. I've been at Drexel for three years, and only just joined the IDM program last year. Initially, I was a Materials Science student, but I felt that I was not interacting with people enough in the workplace, nor was I developing products that seemed to improve peoples' lives. That led me to the IDM program, which has since been an excellent fit for me.

Growing up I was constantly outdoors hiking, running, and swimming while also taking pictures. Here at Drexel that has translated into involvement with the DragonClimbers and Weekend Warriors. Also, I have always had a passion for food and cooking, so I've been working part-time in Philadelphia at Metropolitan Bakery. That allows me to interact with the broader community and work with food. Moreover, I am able to work alongside a photographer and designer to edit the bakery's website and photos.

At Drexel, I hope to continually develop my skills as a digital content creator as well as a photographer. I hope to partner with more students who are trying to develop their own brand as their photographer or web designer. Moreover, I hope to explore the city of Philadelphia more. First and foremost, I am a resident here and I hope to learn everything I can about the city and its residents. One way I like to do this is to walk around the city with my camera in hand, taking pictures of the cityscape and the citizens of philadelphia.

Professionally, I hope to live and work in either Philadelphia or New York for several years. I am extremely interested in working with Elsevier, Cohere, and Bluecadet in Philadelphia. Also as a young professional, I hope to develop some sort of nonprofit or organization that works to increase access to technology and digital education for children in the city.

Above is a link to my resume, where a pdf copy can be downloaded. Moreover, my portfolio is located on the same site as well.

## **Site Content** ##

My portfolio houses some of my best work that would be carried over onto the new site.

My blog is a more general space for content that I create, but I would also pull from this to add onto the new site.

This is a game that I developed alongside other students for GMAP 260. In this game, I worked on the asset creation and level design. Since, it is a fully fleshed out demo I would certainly include it.
