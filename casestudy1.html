            Painted Forms
        </h2>
        <p class="bodytext">
            Through these photos, I sought to challenge peoples' comfort levels; I wanted to clearly define the boundary between sanity and insanity, the boundary between the grotesque and the ordinary. Technically, this series was a challenge. I had to develop painted patterns that combined with the physical geometry of the model. I had to work within the limits of paint as it dried. As the color began to crack, I had to adjust my vision for the shoot and implement a new strategy. This led me to introduce water into the shoot to then achieve unique effects.

            The above photos illustrate the work I did mixing paint and water on a human form. Playing with the shade and the human expression, I sought to generate dynamic and grotesque images.

            In the above image, I sought to play with the concepts of sensuality and mystique. By combining the harsh daylight and shadows and the light tints and dark shades, the turned simple image into a convoluted story of emotion.

        <p class="bodytext">
            In this last image, I combined the human form, painted expressions, and natural material in one shot. Overall, I sought to create layers of depth in the image to draw the viewers in.

            The most challenging part of this shoot was actually to desaturate the photos and to work in black and white (BW). Pulling inspiration from the film Psycho, I wanted to process these photos in BW to suggest that the black paint was blood. But working with pure black in Photoshop proved challenging and made me get creative when I lost no information when editing the photos.
